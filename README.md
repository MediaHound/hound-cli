### Development

NOTE: If you do not have npm or gulp you will need to install them globally.

```brew install node```

```npm install --global gulp```


1. Clone the repo into a local folder
2. cd into project folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `(sudo) npm link` to link this local build to your global command prompt.
5. You can now run `hound` and it will use your local build.

#### Gulp Tasks

Running `gulp` will lint, style-check, and run unit tests.
